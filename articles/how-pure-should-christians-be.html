			<h1>How pure should Christians be?</h1>
			<h2>How to apply "being in the world, but not of it"</h2>

			<br>
			<p class="sidenote-centre">This article has been adapted from an essay I wrote for a school assignment.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Origin</h3>
			<p>
				During Jesus’ prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, recorded in
				<span class="blueletter">John 17:1-26</span>, Jesus spoke to the Father, and pleaded with Him for
				many things. Among His prayer lies the origin of the phrase “in the world but not of it”; Jesus says:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="redletter">
				I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as 
				I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest 
				take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, 
				even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent 
				me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
			</blockquote>
			<cite>&mdash; John 17:14-18 KJV</cite>

			<p>
				There is so much truth in just these four verses, you may write a whole sermon on them alone – maybe 
				even one for each of them – but what I want to focus on is this repeated phrase that we are not of the 
				world.
			</p>

			<h3>Christ is of the Father</h3>
			<p>
				Indeed, Christ is not of the world. Christ is of the Father, He is His only begotten Son – 
				"<span class="blueletter">Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">Psalms 19:2b</span>), 
				"<span class="blueletter">I will be his father, and he shall be my Son</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">2 Samuel 7:14a</span>) – likewise, being made anew in Him 
				(<span class="blueletter">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>) 
				and with Him living in us 
				(<span class="blueletter">Galatians 2:20</span>), neither are we of the world, but are made co-heirs 
				with Christ 
				(<span class="blueletter">Romans 8:17</span>, 
				<span class="blueletter">Titus 3:7</span>), and citizens of heaven 
				(<span class="blueletter">Philippians 3:20</span>). By His blood we are reconciled with God 
				(<span class="blueletter">Romans 5:10</span>). Just as the Father sent Christ into the world, 
				"<span class="blueletter">As thou hast sent me into the world"</span>, Christ also bought us 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>) and sent us into the world, 
				<span class="blueletter">"even so have I also sent them into the world"</span>, to do His bidding and 
				glorify Him. As 
				<span class="blueletter">1 Corinthians 11:3</span> states, 
				"<span class="blueletter">the head of the woman is man, and the head of the man is Christ</span>" – Paul 
				lays out this God-glorifying system wherein the woman passes up her glory to the husband, and the husband 
				to Christ, and Christ to the Father.
			</p>

			<h3>Why are we here?</h3>
			<p>
				That is our purpose here; that is the reason why we are kept in the world, why Jesus prayed that we would 
				not be taken out. We are here for His purpose, for His glory, as we were created by Him and for Him 
				(<span class="blueletter">Colossians 1:16</span>). Of course we cannot do this by ourselves, that is why 
				Jesus promised us and the Father sent forth the great Helper or Comforter in Jesus’ name – the Holy Spirit 
				of God, who strengthens us and gives us power to be witnesses of Christ 
				(<span class="blueletter">Acts 1:8</span>). We are in the world to be the salt and light 
				(<span class="blueletter">Matthew 5:13-16</span>), to be ambassadors of Christ and of heaven 
				(<span class="blueletter">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>, 
				<span class="blueletter">Ephesians 6:20</span>), to show to others the love of the Father by loving Him 
				and each other 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 John 4:17-21</span>), and of course to make disciples of all nations 
				(<span class="blueletter">Matthew 28:18-20</span>). Thus, we are in the world, for a great reason, even 
				while we are not of it. As Jesus said, 
				"<span class="redletter">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of 
				the world, but I have chosen out of the world, therefore the world hateth you</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">John 15:19</span>).
			</p>

			<h3>How to apply this</h3>
			<p>
				This begs the question, "how does this apply to the practical lives of Christians today?" Well, we may 
				look at the rest of the New Testament to see how the Apostles put this into practice. In 1 Corinthians 8, 
				Paul acknowledges that idols are nothing, saying 
				"<span class="blueletter">As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice 
				unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>). This is the Christian confirmation that there is nothing 
				wrong with the eating of meat given to idols, because idols are nothing. Today, lots of meat you buy in shops 
				or at restaurants is halal, it is offered up to the Muslim god before being slain. We know that there is 
				nothing wrong with eating these meats, as they were offered up to nothing; not to mention we also pray 
				God’s blessing upon the food. However, for a man recently converted from Islam to Christianity, his conscience 
				may be greatly defiled at eating this meat which he for so long ate to please the false god. Thus, the more 
				knowledgeable among us ought not eat that meat and flaunt our liberty to do so, 
				"<span class="blueletter">take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a sublingblock to them 
				that are weak</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Corinthians 8:9</span>), lest our brother err. Note that Paul’s only contention 
				with the eating of this meat is out of love and concern for the weaker brother, not an objection for God’s sake – 
				"<span class="blueletter">meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if 
				we eat not, are we the worse</span> 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>). Thus, as it pertains to meat offered to idols, Christians 
				need not worry about eating it, and may enjoy the food, provided they have prayed God’s blessing upon it, and 
				the eating thereof does not defile another brother’s conscience.
			</p>

			<h3>What is not allowed?</h3>
			<p>
				That said, there are clearly situations Christians should not participate in. In 1 Peter 4, Peter writes about us, 
				in times past, participating in the ways of the Gentiles, walking in 
				"<span class="blueletter">lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable 
				idolatries</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Peter 4:3</span>). The Greek word translated as "banquetings" literally means "drinking 
				parties". These are things which are wrong to all men of God, whether they defile their consciences or not, as they 
				are abominable to the Lord. You may raise the question of living under grace not law, and I would agree that we are 
				dead to sin, but nonetheless we are called to be consecrated peoples, in a passage I will get more into soon. Thus 
				I must conclude that the Bible certainly condemns participating in many of the ways of the culture; today we see a 
				world of rampant sexual immorality, lies, idols, hate, but the Lord commands us to 
				"<span class="blueletter">have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them</span>" 
				(<span class="blueletter">Ephesians 5:11</span>).
			</p>

			<h3>What are we to do?</h3>
			<p>
				The verses I referenced earlier, about being called to be a consecrated people, is 
				<span class="blueletter">Romans 12:1-2</span>: 
				"<span class="blueletter">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a 
				living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, 
				but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, 
				will of God.</span>" "<em>The Christian is like a ship which is made to float in the water</em>", said Pastor Chuck 
				Smith, "<em>As long as it’s floating on the water, it’s alright. The only danger is when you get water in the ship.</em>" 
				We are God’s chosen 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Peter 2:9</span>, 
				<span class="blueletter">John 15:16</span>) and holy people, ordained before time to be here for His purpose 
				(<span class="blueletter">2 Timothy 1:9</span>), to do good works in Christ Jesus 
				(<span class="blueletter">Ephesians 2:10</span>), to love the Lord with all our heart and soul 
				(<span class="blueletter">Mark 12:30</span>), to love one another 
				(<span class="blueletter">Mark 12:31</span>), to be hearers and doers of the Word 
				(<span class="blueletter">James 1:19-27</span>), and to live up to our calling 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>) by serving God in every thing we do 
				(<span class="blueletter">Colossians 3:23</span>). We are to abhor and abstain from evil, and cleave to that which is good 
				(<span class="blueletter">Romans 12:9</span>), for all things which are good are of God 
				(<span class="blueletter">James 1:17</span>, 
				<span class="blueletter">Romans 8:28</span>) but all things which are in the world – the lust of the flesh, the lust of 
				the eyes, the pride of life – are not of the Father 
				(<span class="blueletter">1 John 2:15-17</span>).
			</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				We are in the world, on a special commission from the Lord Jesus, for as long as the Holy Spirit shall restrain the evil 
				(<span class="blueletter">2 Thessalonians 2:6-7</span>) and until the Father sends His Son 
				(<span class="blueletter">Matthew 24:26</span>). We have been given plenty to do in the meantime! Do not allow the love 
				of the world to come into you, but follow the Word of God in the Lord Jesus Christ, letting Him reign in you 
				(<span class="blueletter">John 14:20</span>, 
				<span class="blueletter">Colossians 3:15</span>).
