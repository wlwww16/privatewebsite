			<h1>Stop looking in mirrors</h1>
			<h2>Practical advice about looking in mirrors</h2>
			<h3>Opening verse</h3>
			<p>I'd like to start by reading some verses from James 1.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<strong>22</strong> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 
				<strong>23</strong> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man 
				beholding his natural face in a glass: <strong>24</strong> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth 
				his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
			</blockquote>
			<cite>&mdash; James 1:22-24 KJV</cite>

			<h3>Vanity</h3>
			<p>
				There are two different places we could turn to in order to define what exactly 'vanity' is. 
				The first is any old dictionary, I'll use The Free Dictionary, for example:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				Excessive pride in one's appearance or accomplishments; conceit.
			</blockquote>
			<cite>&mdash; The Free Dictionary</cite>

			<p>
				Of course, this is an apt definition, particularly in our use case; gazing into a mirror all day 
				long would certainly be considered taking excessive pride in yourself, which is condemned 
				multiple times in the Bible (Proverbs 8:13, 11:12, 16:5 16:18; Mark 7:20-23; James 4:6; 1 John 
				2:16; to name a few).
			</p>

			<h3>King Solomon's vanity</h3>
			<p>
				That said, let us also turn to Ecclesiastes, written by King Solomon, son of David. In this book, 
				Solomon weeps over all his wordly riches (such as his 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 
				11:3) or his silver as abundant as stones (2 Chronicles 9:27)) amounting to nothing, and calls 
				all these things "vanity".
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<strong>2</strong> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <em>is</em> vanity.
			</blockquote>
			<cite>&mdash; Ecclesiastes 1:2 KJV</cite>

			<p>
				Solomon goes on to write that all his labour under the sun is vanity. All his wisdom, everything, is 
				vanity. Now, you might be wondering, how are those things "excessive pride in one's appearance or 
				accomplishments"? After all, he is not at all boasting in his work, rather, lamenting it! 
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<strong>22</strong> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he 
				hath laboured under the sun? <strong>23</strong> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; 
				yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
			</blockquote>
			<cite>&mdash; Ecclesiastes 2:22-23 KJV</cite>

			<p>
				Well, the word vanity is Strong's Hebrew 1892, the Hebrew word "הֶבֶל" or "hebel" in the Latin alphabet. 
				What this word really means is literally "vapour" or "breath", the implication thereof being that 
				something is entirely temporal in nature, fleeting, or passing; it lasts for but a moment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Indeed his wealth and riches and oxen and land and properties did last for but a moment. The Lord 
				swiftly took everything from Solomon, even his kingdom, for his abominable works as recorded in 
				1 Kings 11.
			</p>

			<h3>Mirrors</h3>
			<p>
				"Okay, okay", I hear you ask, "and what does this have to do with looking in the mirror?" Firstly, 
				have a little patience! Secondly, consider this; how often do you look in a mirror just 
				<em>once</em>? Or is it more fair to suggest you gaze upon your own reflection multiple times?
			</p>

			<p>
				One might say this is vanity. You look and behold your own image, taking pride in your appearance, 
				but you soon forget what you look like and return to the mirror for reassurance!
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking in the mirror is the ultimate act of vanity. It passes the test on both of our definitions, 
				it relies on yourself for assurance; it puts the focus on you rather than the Lord... Am I looking 
				too much into this? Perhaps. Nonetheless, I shall continue:
			</p>

			<h3>Confidence</h3>
			<p>
				Even if you do not consider it vanity, or you do not care if it is prideful, or you are sure it is 
				not an issue, allow me to make one final suggestion. In my own experience, a mirror only ever served 
				as fuel for an (even bigger) ego, or dragged me down and made me feel terrible.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since not looking in the mirror, or rather, since avoiding it as much as possible, my confidence has 
				greatly improved. Sure, one day you may miss some toothpaste on your shirt, or something the like, but 
				a family member really ought to have pointed that out for you anyway ;-). Without a piece of glass to 
				tell me I look terrible, I care less about what I look like, but simultaneously feel I look better.
			</p>

			<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<p>
				To conclude; a challenge. It is simple - try and go one day without checking yourself in the mirror. 
				If it is easy, excellent! Go for two days, three days, a week; see how long you last. If you struggle 
				to even make it a few hours as I did, work on that, pray through that. God bless you all.
			</p>
