            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Pasta</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>400g flour</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Filling</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>1 large butternut squash</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>8tbsp grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Method</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Put the flour and cracked eggs into the food processor and mix until a cohesive ball of dough forms.
                    If you opted to not use a food processor, pour the flour onto a work surface in a neat pile and form
                    a well in the centre. Into this centre, crack the four eggs. Whisk with a fork, slowly incorporating
                    more and more flour. Once you've done all you can with the fork, get in there with your hands and
                    form the ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take the dough on the work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and, when a finger is pressed
                    onto it, the dough slowly springs back up, approximately 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Tightly wrap with cling film and leave to rest for no less than 30 minutes, on the counter.</li>
                <li>
                    Remove approximately half an inch from the top and from the bottom of the squash, then slice it in
                    half, length-wise. Remove the seed-laden core from the squash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drizzle the squash with olive oil and place cut-side down on the parchment lined baking tray. Roast
                    at 190&deg;C for 45m-1h or until deeply browned and soft to the point where a knife will pierce with
                    very little resistance. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unwrap the dough and cut it into four equally sized balls. For each of the balls, do the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roll through the pasta roller (or with a rolling pin on a well-floured surface) once.</li>
                        <li>Fold the top and bottom thirds of the sheet of dough so that they meet in the middle.</li>
                        <li>Repeat this process until the sheet is very thin and smooth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scoop out the flesh from the squash halves and put into a food processor (or into a large mixing
                    bowl), then add in the parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and a glug of olive oil. Blend/mix until very
                    smooth and leave to continue cooling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place small dollops of the filling approximately 1 inch apart on the bottom (width-wise) half of the
                    pasta sheet, using some water to wet the area around each dollop which will act as if it were glue.
                    Once this is done, fold the top half over the bottom and firmly press around each filling dollop to
                    ensure it is properly sealed. If they are not sealed, steam will build up during cooking and explode
                    the ravioli.
                </li>
                <li>Once sealed, cut into individual parcels with a knife.</li>
                <li>
                    Boil the ravioli until they determinedly float to the top in a pot of boiling, salted water,
                    approximately 3-5 minutes. Do not overcook.
                </li>

                <li>Serve with your favourite sauce.</li>
            </ol>
