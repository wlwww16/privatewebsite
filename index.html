            <h3>Opening words</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my website. This is a place for me to post articles about a wide variety of topics, discuss my faith, and share my thoughts with the 
                world (or all 3 people who will likely see this site), in a manner that is not subject to the control, censorship, nor heckling of a Twitter page.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, this page could still be shut down by GitHub, owned by Microsoft, but I only see this form of hosting as a temporary solution. When I 
                can reliably afford to pay for a domain and server, I will host this site myself.
            </p>
