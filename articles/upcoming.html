            <h3>Liberty</h3>
            <p>True "liberty" is the freedom serve God, not to do as you please (which will please the devil). This is
                not news, but I thought it
                useful to write down.
            </p>

            <blockquote><strong>16</strong> As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the
                servants of God.
            </blockquote>
            <cite>&mdash; 1 Peter 2:16 KJV</cite>

            <p>The word "maliciousness" is the Greek <em>κακία</em>, meaning evil, wickedness, depravity. Liberty is not
                the freedom to fulfill worldly desires and fleshly lusts, as they are evil, wicked, and depraved.
