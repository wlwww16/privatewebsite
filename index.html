            <h3>Opening words</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my website. This is a place for me to post articles about a wide variety of topics, discuss my
                faith, and share my thoughts with the
                world (or all 3 people who will likely see this site), in a manner that is not subject to the control,
                censorship, nor heckling of a Twitter page.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, this page could still be shut down by GitHub, owned by Microsoft, but I only see this form of
                hosting as a temporary solution. When I
                can reliably afford to pay for a domain and server, I will host this site myself.
            </p>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <h4>Why the minimalist design?</h4>
            <p>I don't like modern web design. It's all corporate, devoid of personality, full of ads and trackers, and
                generally "bloated". I also find it pleasing to look at a minimalist page, and it's <em>my</em> website.
                Unlike a Facebook or Twitter page where, at best, you can change a profile icon and small banner, this
                entire site is my canvas and the design of everything is my personal choice;
                <span class="meta">I could have all text look like this, if I really wanted to</span>.
            </p>
            <p>This is what I want my site to look like. You can make your site look and function how you please, that
                is the beauty of what the internet <em>should</em> be, without corporate monopolies taking the fun out
                of it.
