            <h1>Walking in the world</h1>
            <h2>Exploring the course of my dead self</h2>
            <h3>Opening verse</h3>
            <p>I'd like to start by reading some verses from Ephesians 2.</p>

            <blockquote><strong>1</strong> And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
                <strong>2</strong> Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to
                the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
                <strong>3</strong> Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,
                fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
                others. <strong>4</strong> But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
                <strong>5 </strong> when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are
                saved;) <strong>6</strong> And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places
                in Christ Jesus: <strong>7</strong> That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
                grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. <strong>8</strong> For by grace are ye saved
                through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: <strong>9</strong> Not of works, lest
                any man should boast.
            </blockquote>
            <cite>&mdash; Ephesians 2:1-9 KJV</cite>

            <h3>A conviction</h3>
            <p>
                The Spirit laid this conviction on me tonight, as I write this, that I am not thanking the Lord enough
                for what He did for me. I dug in the far corners of my memory for titles of songs I listened to in years
                past. I remembered a few (praise be to God, my memory is not the best) and looked them up on the
                internet. I was apalled by what I heard when I listened.
            </p>

            <h3>Beneath the surface</h3>
            <p>
                Once one digs beneath the surface of flashy beats and pleasing vocals, which are totally artificial, and
                analyses the lyrics of these songs, you will be appalled; appalled not only at the vices these people
                are indulging in, and the demons they have in them, but that, at least in my case, you, as a child, the
                one time you are as close to innocent as you will ever be in this world, listened to such things which
                are of the world.
            </p>

            <h3>Tarnished innocence</h3>
            <p>
                Whether younger Will understood the meaning of certain things in the media I "consoomed", I will never
                know, but it is beyond the question. By association with these things, my innocence was tarnished. I
                knew about how great smoking weed was, I knew about women and how prized having sex with them was, I
                knew about how cool drinking was; I could go on. Especially once I got to high school, I was surrounded
                by such degeneracy, such evil. One might say I
                <em>walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>He held onto me</h3>
            <p>
                Truth be told, I don't know where I would have ended up if I had continued fulfilling the desires of the
                flesh and of the mind. I was never one of the "cool kids", but I did fit into a niche of bad people
                nonetheless. I did get invited to parties (okay, <em>a</em> party), I was around drink and drugs, I did
                things I "regret" (though it is worth noting I do not wish they didn't happen, and I thank God for
                allowing those situations to occur), and I believe it is entirely possible I would have gone to a far
                worse, far far darker place. And yet, even at the time, comparing myself to my peers, I didn't seem as
                troubled by addictions as them. I didn't smoke, in fact I found (and still find) it repulsive, I wasn't
                an alcoholic, but I was certainly no saint. At the time this only served to fuel my ego, my attitude
                that I was clearly superior to these people for not being as weak-willed as they were, but I can look
                back now and only say three words:
            </p>

            <h3>Thank you, Lord</h3>
            <p>Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for your protective hand over me. Thank you, Lord, for your allowing me
                to go through those trials. Thank you, Lord, for plucking me out of such desturctive, soul-destroying
                path, wide and accommodating of such vice, taking my hand and leading me to the narrow path of eternal
                life, leaving me dead to sin and alive in Christ, and filling me with your Spirit as an assurance of
                salvation. Thank you, Lord, for your Son, Jesus Christ my Saviour, the firstfruits of the resurrection,
                my guarantee of everlasting life with you, oh Lord, thank you.
            </p>
